Q: Twitter support seems to be disabled. How can I twit via
pidgin-twitter?

A:
Since Twitter's IM gateway bot has been offlined for long time, you
need to setup API based twitter access.

Please make sure that screen name for twitter has been properly
configured, "Get/post statuses via API" has been enabled and the
password has been properly configured.

Pidgin-twitter works as following: it watches all conversations, if a
conversation is initiated with one of the "bot account", it starts to
work. In API based twitter access, pidgin-twitter still use this
machinery. So your account for twitter must have "twitter@twitter.com"
in its buddy list.

To add that, please login gtalk with your account which you want to
use for twitter, then choose "Add buddy" from "Buddies" menu in buddy
list window. "Add buddy" dialog will appear, please add
twitter@twitter.com to your gtalk account there. This buddy need not
appear on the buddy list because it is always offline. You can confirm
that it has been successfully added to the list by checking "show
offline buddies" (Buddies->Show->Offline buddies). I recommend
applying "show when offline" on twitter@twitter.com for convenience.
