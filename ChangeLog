From first release (Pidgin 2.5.4 ver1) to current (Pidgin 2.5.5 ver2):
- fixed some bugs in the Gtk+ framework to make
  it working bundled in an app-bundle
- statically linked in most official Pidgin plugins
  (but extended Pidgin source that not all of them are
  loaded by default)
- build own Gtk+ framework from Gtk+ SVN trunk
- MacOSX notify support (the icon jumps on a new message
  or any other event; that is the pidgin_set_urgent
  function)
- OTR plugin builtin (based on Pidgin OTR 3.1.0)
- added SSL support (builtin GnuTLS 2.6.4)
- updated Pidgin source to 2.5.5
- Facebookchat plugin builtin
- Gfire plugin builtin
